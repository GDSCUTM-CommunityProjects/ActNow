# ActNow

We are a social media platform designed to make you look at your phone less.

## Introduction

In the last few years, the entire planet has been deeply affected by the covid-19 pandemic. As a result, drastic changes had to be made about how people interact with each in order to stop the spread of this deadly virus. Luckily, with the widespread adoption of the covid-19 vaccine, countries such as Canada has began to loosen the restrictions on social interactions.

At ActNow, our mission is to promote healthy interactions between people by providing a massive events platform that's able to help individuals find others with similar interests through our interactive maps.

Our software is open-source and we are always trying to improve it. Our docs website below will serve as a guide on how our software works and how you will be able to contribute.

Thank you for visiting! ðŸ˜€
