# Intro

<h3>Purpose:</h3>

The purpose of the application team is to work on the application and its major features such as the map pings and its related work, etc. Our main focus is currently is to code more of the homepage and display a map using Google APIs.


<h3>Path</h3>

The Application team's work can be found under `ActNow/src/app/lib/`. For now all of the code is just in the lib directory, but as we continue to code and the application gets bigger, we will begin to create subdirectories to manage to code better and for a cleaner look. 

Although all of the main work will be done in `ActNow/src/app/lib/`, we will sometimes have to work in the `ActNow/src/app/` main directory for setup issues. For example, in the first week we had to setup firebase and make sure that we could get a connection to the firestore database. To do this basic setup, we had to access many of the files in the apps main directory of `ActNow/src/app/`.


<h3>Usage Example:</h3>

**Requirements:**

- Flutter
- Android Studio (Emulator) / Personal Device
- Editor

Running the application locally is very simple. Once you have the Flutter package installed on your PC and have an emulator running or device connected, you can just run the application from main.dart and it will build the app on your device.

**Example 1**:
`flutter run lib/main.dart`

**Example 2**:
(VS Code) Right click main.dart -> `Run without debugging`
